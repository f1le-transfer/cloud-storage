Cloud/Block Storage

Cloud/Block Storage stores chunks of files uploaded by the users. Clients directly interact with the storage to send and receive objects from it. Separation of the metadata from storage enables us to use any storage either in cloud or in-house.

Block server receives / sends data via tcp protocol. The client or application receives data through directory trees, folders, and individual files. This functions similarly to a local hard drive.
